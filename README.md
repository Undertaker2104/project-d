# Project D

## Installing dependencies

In order to run the tool application, you need be using atleast python 3.11, you will also need to install a few Python packages. It's recommended to install these packages in a virtual environment to prevent weird dependency conflicts:

```sh
python3 -m venv venv
unix: source venv/bin/activate
windows: .\venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
python tool
```

When you run the appliation without arguments, it'll show a help menu. Required PyTorch models are downloaded at runtime.
